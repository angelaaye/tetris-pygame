# Pygame Tetris Game

## Installation
Install pygame on your local drive or virtualenv. Download the files and run using `python tetris.py`. The text file `high_score.txt` is necessary for the code to run.

To play: use left, right and down keys to control the tetris blocks. Rotate the shape using the up key. Press space to instantly drop the block to the bottom. 

To increase the difficulty (rate of block falling), decrease the `fall_time` parameter in the `main_helper()` function.
